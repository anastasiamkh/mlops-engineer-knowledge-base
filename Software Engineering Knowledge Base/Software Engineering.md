An [[MLOps engineer]] should be capable of designing scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-availability systems. This involves not only high-level architectural considerations but also low-level system design, which includes understanding algorithms, data structures, memory management, and concurrency. Understanding microservices architecture and its application in machine learning systems is vital for creating flexible and modular solutions. Additionally, knowledge of system performance optimization and load balancing ensures that the systems can handle varying loads efficiently and remain responsive under high demand.
