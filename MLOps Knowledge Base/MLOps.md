An [[MLOps Engineer]] must be adept in [[model versioning]] and management using tools like MLflow or DVC, ensuring models are consistently tracked and reproducible. Automated model retraining, monitoring, and drift detection are essential for maintaining model performance over time. Additionally, understanding [[deployment strategies]] for ML models, including A/B testing and canary releases, ensures that models are safely and effectively integrated into production environments.
